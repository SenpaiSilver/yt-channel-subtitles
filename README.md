# YouTube Channel Subtitles

This repository contains channel subtitles for my videos. 
The folder for the subs repository follows the simple format of:

    <youtube video id> - <title>/<two letter language code>.ass
    <youtube video id> - <title>/<two letter language code>.srt

Other folders can be created outside of the format for a variety of tools and other resources.

## Tools

[Aegisub](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub) is used for editing the YouTube generated subs and fix them.
